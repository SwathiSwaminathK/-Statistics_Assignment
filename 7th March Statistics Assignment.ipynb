In other words, it measures the extent to which the distribution of data is not symmetrical. A perfectly symmetrical distribution has equal amounts of data on both sides of the mean, resulting in a skewness value of zero. However, if the data distribution has a long tail on one side, it is said to be skewed. A positive skewness value means that the tail is longer on the right side of the distribution, while a negative skewness value means that the tail is longer on the left side of the distribution."

Meanwhile, the mean takes into account the values of all the data points and is influenced by the outliers on the right side, which pulls it towards the right and makes it larger than the median.\n",
