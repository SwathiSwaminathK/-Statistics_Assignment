    "T-Test: Suppose you are a researcher who is interested in comparing the average test scores of two groups of students, Group A and Group B. You have collected a random sample of 20 students from each group, and you want to know if the difference in the means of the two groups is statistically significant. Since the sample size is small (less than 30), you would use a t-test to compare the means of the two groups.\n",

Since the sample size is large (greater than 30) and the population standard deviation is known, you would use a z-test to compare the sample mean to the specified mean weight."
